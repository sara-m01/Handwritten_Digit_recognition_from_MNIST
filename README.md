# Handwritten_Digit_recognition_from_MNIST

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it aims to classify images of digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

## Features
- Utilizes the MNIST dataset containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
- Preprocesses images for normalization and reshaping.
- Builds a CNN model with two convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers.
- Trains the model using the training dataset and evaluates its performance on a test dataset.
- Visualizes predictions against true labels.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the following dependencies:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
